Reactor operators runs on the thread which invokes onNext

time related operators like delayElement changes the execution context that they will continue the execution on a
different thread than the caller thread. In most cases caller thread is main thread


difference between publishOn And subscribeOn?
publishOn will change the execution context from where it's being chained
subscribeOn will change the execution context from the very first irrespective of the position from where it's
being called.

In subscribeOn if there are multiple schedulers, then the scheduler at first will decide the execution context
throughout no other scheduler will have any affect


runsOn:
will divide the flux and will emit in different thread
