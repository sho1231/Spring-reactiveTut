1) Aysnc and non-blocking
    1) Once thread will receive a request it will not wait for the response and will send the
    request to thread pool for it to process, and it will continue to take other request.

Publisher ---> one who generates the data.
Subscriber ---> one who consumes the data and does some processing.
2) Workflow:
    1) First subsriber will subscribe to the publisher.
    2) Publisher will acknowledge and return back a subscription
    3) Subscriber will request data and will also mention how much data they want
    4) Publisher will send the data to the subscriber , the number of data sent will be equal to the number of times
    onNext() method will be executed
    5) Once the data is sent successfully, onComplete() method will be executed else onError() method will be executed.

3) Types of Publishers:
    1) Mono: For publishing 1 element or no element.
    2) Flux: For publishing multiple elements.


4) Map and FlatMap:
map --> will operate on each element synchronously and will return the transformed element
flatmap --> will operate on each element asynchronously and so it will return mono. Also why mono because it's
operating at a time asynchronously on one data. Also why a publisher the reason being is for async operation.
