Difference between concatMap and flapMap?
both are literally same but concat map preserves the order of the flux

transform --> It takes a type as input and we can define some operation as well it's return type

defaultIfEmpty --> We can set a default value to be emitted when nothing is there to be emitted

switchIfEmpty --> We can emit a different set of values when nothing is there to be emitted
